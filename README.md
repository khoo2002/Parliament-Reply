## Framework

## Overview

This project leverages **Dify** and **Gemini** to assist the **ILSED** and **CATD** departments in automating the drafting of Parliament replies. The system is designed to mimic the grammar, tone, and style of previous official replies while integrating accurate, up-to-date statistics and proper citations.

## Objectives

- **Automate Drafting**: Generate high-quality draft replies that align with the linguistic and stylistic standards of past Parliament responses.
- **Ensure Accuracy**: Incorporate the latest statistics from trusted sources.
- **Provide Citations**: Clearly reference both historical and statistical data sources.
- **Improve Efficiency**: Reduce manual effort and turnaround time for preparing replies.

## Data Sources

The system uses two main groups of sources:

1. **Historical Parliament Replies**  
   Used to train the model to replicate the grammar, phrasing, and style typical of official responses.

2. **Statistical Data**  
   Provides current and relevant figures to support the content of the replies. These are cited appropriately in the generated output.

## Technologies Used

- **Dify**: For orchestrating workflows and managing prompt templates.
- **Gemini**: As the core LLM for generating context-aware, stylistically accurate replies.

## Features

- **Style Mimicry**: Replies emulate the tone and structure of previous Parliament documents.
- **Dynamic Data Integration**: Automatically pulls in the latest statistics.
- **Citation Support**: Each reply includes references to both historical and statistical sources.
- **Customizable Prompts**: Tailored to different types of questions and departments.

## Usage

1. Input a draft question or topic.
2. The system analyzes the context and retrieves relevant historical replies and statistics.
3. A draft reply is generated, complete with citations.
4. Review and finalize the reply before submission.
